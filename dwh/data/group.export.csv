1.0,9421582,Little Bangkok Sangha : Meditation group,active,https://www.meetup.com/Little-Bangkok-Sangha-Meditation-group/,Little-Bangkok-Sangha-Meditation-group,"<p><br>

Hi - welcome to our Little Bangkok Sangha.</p>
<p>When I came to Bangkok in 2001 there was no dharma in English to be found. The temples are all happy to compete for the tourist dollar, but there was no explanations, no sangha, no friends on the path.</p>
<p>So I started the ball rolling. That was 2007. Now we organize lots of events, and bring people together from all kinds of meditation backgrounds.</p>
<p>There are regular dhamma talks, workshops, discussion events, lunches and sometimes retreats. It depends on visiting teachers schedules.</p>
<p>Since we have no permanent venue of our own (yet) we have few costs. Pretty much everything we do is without cost - except for retreats of course - but even those are as low cost as we can make it.</p>
<p>I hope you can join in. If you are new it takes a while for your face and name to be remembered, but you should find an interesting mix of people. (plus a few real oddballs!)</p>
<p>The full website is at www.littlebang.org  - the calendars there feature all events, arranged by us and other groups. Here on Meetup we only feature our own events - that's already a ton of emails that Meetup sends out!!</p>
<p>Hope to meet you.</p>

<p>It can be quite daunting socializing &amp; putting a circle of friends together when moving to a new city. A little less daunting after 6 or 7 Changs or whiskey sours are involved though. If you're a person that can relate to that sentiment than this is the Meetup for you. </p>
<p>Think after work drinks on a Friday afternoon as soon as it's culturally appropriate. Think of cocktails on a Sunday afternoon. Think of downing a regrettable tequila shooter at the bar at 11pm on Saturday before someone bully's you into going to that club you said you'd never go too. </p>

<p><b>About GraphQL</b></p>
<p>GraphQL was developed internally at Facebook in 2012. Its main goal was to allow Native Mobile teams to quickly build new products and collaborate within the large Facebook ecosystem without disrupting existing Data Services. In July 2015, Facebook decided to open source it. They published an specification (<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/graphql/"" class=""linkified"">https://facebook.github.io/graphql/</a>), and provided a reference implementation, using JavaScript (graphql-js (<a href=""https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js</a>)), to get feedback from the community and allow other implementations to emerge.</p>
<p>GraphQL can be used either to refer to the GraphQL Specification (<a href=""https://facebook.github.io/graphql/"" class=""linkified"">https://facebook.github.io/graphql/</a>), an implementation of a GraphQL Server or the Data Query Language.</p>
<p>Today there are many GraphQL Server implementations using: Python (graphene (<a href=""https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene</a>)), Scala (sangria (<a href=""https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria</a>)), Go (<a href=""https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql</a>), PHP (<a href=""https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php</a>), Java (<a href=""https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java</a>) and more (<a href=""https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql"" class=""linkified"">https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql</a>)!</p>",1529165862,Bangkok,Bangkok,TH,Thailand,"Bangkok, Thailand",,open,public,13.73,100.5,481,74023502,Tobias Meixner,"AWS Solution Architect in Bangkok,

<p>***<br></p>
<p>In order to increase the quantity and quality of feedback we receive on our writing we are revamping the format of our meet-ups. This is a work in progress; nothing will be carved in stone. We’ll try it, see how it works, and then either tweak it or start all over again. (Kind of like writing, isn’t it?)<br><br>So, here’s a big picture description of what we’re doing:<br><br>There will no longer be time allotted during the meet-ups for reading the pieces. Any work that you would like to have critiqued will need to be posted to the website by Wednesday before the Sunday meet-up so that we will have time to read it. You should keep bringing paper copies so we can write comments on them. Start time will be at 11:00 and discussion will start promptly at 11:20.<br><br>For discussion we will go around the table allowing each person an allotted amount of interruption-free talk time to address the piece and when their time is up, it’s up, and the floor will be given to the next person. Then when everyone has been given a chance to talk about a piece we’ll go on to the next one. The host will be in charge of managing time. Time allotted to each story will depend on the number of stories we have on that day.<br><br>Story limit remains 5,000 words but if you have a longer piece and you post your story before the deadline, chances are we’ll read it. We’ll discuss the stories in the order they’re posted on the website. Please keep the comments related to writing, not the subject matter.<br><br>! NEW MEMBERS !<br><br>You will have to come to at least 3 meet-ups over a period of 3 months before you’ll be given access to the group’s private website.<br>After you RSVP for the first time, I will send you a private message. Please respond no later than the Friday before the meet-up. If you don’t, I will remove you from the list. (We’ve had far too many people who RSVP, don’t show up, and are never heard of again. It creates problems with booking the seats, and time allocation for each story.) That also means you will have to RSVP by Friday (the meet-up is on Sunday).<br><br>If it’s your first meet-up with us, you can just come and see how we do things – no need to bring anything unless you want to. For the next couple of meet-ups you can bring a piece of writing – 2000 words or less – on paper copies and we will provide feedback. When you are given access to the website you’ll be able to post longer pieces there.<br><br>We’ll start the meet-up with feedback for the stories that have been posted to the website. When that’s done we will read your work and discuss it. Please make sure you have enough printed copies for everyone.<br>You can bring any type of writing: essays, memoirs, short stories, blog posts, a piece from your novel, poetry, etc.<br></p>",1417145000,Bangkok,Bangkok,TH,Thailand,"Bangkok, Thailand",,open,public,13.73,100.5,348,182649013,Ed Kinney,,Asia/Bangkok,36,Writing

1.0,18869090,Bangkok Philosophy and Great Classics Discussion Group,active,https://www.meetup.com/Bangkok-Philosophy-and-Great-Classics-Discussion-Group/,Bangkok-Philosophy-and-Great-Classics-Discussion-Group,"<p>The raison d'etre of this group can be found in the word of Adam Smith. &nbsp; &nbsp;He writes,</p>
<p>""When we have read a book or poem so often that we can no longer find any amusement in reading it by ourselves, we can still take pleasure in reading it to a companion. To him it has all the graces of novelty; we enter into the surprise and admiration which it naturally excites in him, but which it is no longer capable of exciting in us; we consider all the ideas which it presents rather in the light in which they appear to him, than in that in which they appear to ourselves, and we are amused by sympathy with his amusement which thus enlivens our own.”</p>
<br>
<p>The purpose of this group is to elucidate complex short works of philosophy. &nbsp;The goal is not to observe or give generalized impressions from having read a particular work decades ago or rehash the meaning of a particular phrase that is known universally but to have a book in front of you to cite directly or indirectly after having done the reading. &nbsp;When I conceptualized the group I assumed it would involve individuals talking about certain passages of interest from the first ten pages, the next ten pages, and so on, with conversation being built around it. &nbsp;I also assumed that it would consist of &nbsp;several fairly committed and responsible people who would come each time and become friends in the shared admiration of great and thoughtful masters, NOT in derailing the purpose by veering the conversation off the tracks in full refutation and dismissal &nbsp;of what we are studying, or being fed a few morsels from which you are able to give clever repartees. &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw it as a means to be of assistance to others in this goal to approach truth and understanding of the text. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As Mortimer Adler states it in <i>How to Read a Book </i>the only person who knows a book fully is the author, and so the reader is trying to come as close to reaching the author's understanding as he can do. &nbsp;If you click the button saying that you will come you need to do it weeks before the meeting and that click needs to mean something. &nbsp;It needs to be a solemn pledge that you will read the material to the best of your ability and help the group members in understanding the work. &nbsp;It should not be some lackadaisical idea that if you have time and remember to come you will have a beer and run your mouth. &nbsp;Yes, we have had occurences where the group was hostage to people making long speeches decrying a work and arguing in favor of an entirely different author. &nbsp;These are serious writers, and our group has a serious agenda, so why treat it with such flippant disdain?&nbsp; &nbsp;If your membership was deleted you are welcome to rejoin the group but there are questions that you must answer first. Call it a litmus test or vetting process in a sense, as I want to find out if you have the ability to appreciate the sacrifices these very great men made of their lives to give to you their higher thoughts. A candidate for these meetings must be humbled by this great gift and I want to know that he or she will actually read the material and come into the meeting with it in his or her hands. It isnt a lot to ask for, is it? And if you state that you will come with an RSVP, contribute somehow by at least contributing to the discussion board if you cannot be present. &nbsp; <br></p>",1440556418,Bangkok,Bangkok,TH,Thailand,"Bangkok, Thailand",,open,public,13.73,100.5,50,12721704,PAUL ILLERT,,Asia/Bangkok,6,Education & Learning

<p>Please join us for a fun and exciting Toastmaster meeting. We meet every Tuesday at 6.30 pm for around 2 hours. Meetings take place in Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit Hotel at Asoke.</p> 
<p>Learn How to Communicate with Confidence and Impact</p> 
<p>Have you ever felt like expressing your opinion in front of others, but something held you back inside? Perhaps it was a lack of confidence, or not knowing what to say in the heat of the moment. It's a common problem that holds many people back from advancing in their career and personal ambitions.</p> 
<p>Toastmasters provides the perfect training ground for you to practice conveying your messages with confidence and passion. At our club, you can develop the skills you need to become a lifelong leader. Our organization has helped many people advance to senior management and executive positions, improve their relationships with family and friends, and become more effective communicators and leaders.</p> 
<p>Who are the Capitol Toastmasters?</p> 
<p>“Cappies” come from many backgrounds. Our current group includes business professionals, expatriates, executives, entrepreneurs, parents and college graduates.</p> 
<p>We meet together each week with the shared purpose of developing our communication and leadership skills. Besides the speaker role, which Toastmasters is most well known for, members also participate as event hosts, evaluators, and numerous other structured leadership functions at every meeting.</p> 
<p> Capitol Toastmasters is the largest and most diverse toastmasters club in Bangkok</p> 
<p>There are several Toastmasters clubs in the Bangkok area, and it's a good idea to visit a few of them. With more than 70 members, Capitol Toasmasters is currently the largest and most diverse club in Bangkok.</p> 
<p>Members come from across the world. With members from more than 30 countries, club meetings are always culturally diverse. Visit one of our meetings and you'll sense an environment mixing a strong professional atmosphere with a little bit of fun, a lot of humor, and an array of individual cultural perspectives that help make our meetings the highlight of the week.</p> 
<p>How do I visit as a guest?</p> 
<p>Guests are always welcome to attend any of our regular meetings. We meet on the following days and times:</p> 
<p>Every Tuesday at 6:30 - 8:30 PM</p> 
<p>Cost: 200 Baht per person, paid at the door.</p> 
<p>Location: Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit Hotel It is located next to the BTS Asoke and MRT Sukhumvit stations. We are usually on the second level, but just ask in the lobby and they will direct you to our meeting. Directions: Due to the high traffic on Sukhumvit around our meeting time, it is recommended that you take the skytrain or subway to the hotel. Our meeting room is just a few steps away. Here’s how to get there:</p> 
<p>1. Get off at the Asoke BTS/MRT exit. If at the MRT station, walk to the BTS terminal.</p> 
<p>2. Find Exit 1, and continue westward another 30 meters. You'll see a large sign out in front of the Sheraton Grand.</p> 
<p>3. We typically meet on the second floor; you’ll see a large Toastmasters banner outside our room. The hotel staff is very helpful and will guide you to our room.</p> 
<p>A final note about the club</p> 
<p>Guests and new members come for the personal development opportunities. They find themselves staying for the contacts they meet and the friendships they develop from all over the world. It’s true we grow together at every meeting. But we also have fun together.

Politics, economics, medicine, and the arts also try to provide us with Relative happiness. We seek for this type of happiness day in, day out hoping we can attain true satisfaction from it.

Cost is between 100 and 300 baht for the run and refreshments (basically all you can drink). If you stay for the dinner it is normally an additional 200 to 250 baht.

We meet at Benkakitti Park (the one with the big lake in the middle) 2-3 times per week for a vigorous one-hour workout.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The workout can be quite hard, and a calorie burn of &gt;600 is not unusual. A typical workout challenges the group to run one 2 KM lap around the park while stopping at 3-4 ""X stations"" where we do sets of push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, planks, mountain climbers, step-ups, lunges, sprints and the like. A ""favorite"" feature is the ""push-run"" back to the starting point whereby the group runs in a line while the last person drops and does a push-up before catching up with the group and changing places with the next person in line.</span></p>
<p>Each session has someone who volunteers to ""Q"" or design/lead the workout. So, every workout is different.</p>
<p>On weekends, we often have coffee afterwards, so there is a nice social angle to this.</p>
<p>While there isn't any formal storage area, most members leave their personal belongings at the starting point.</p>

Let's raise our vibration (•ᴗ•) Singing together is a profoundly human activity. All ages, cultures and backgrounds welcome! Families and small kids welcome! <br> <br>Kirtan (pronounced <i>keer-tahn</i>) is a musical conversation, where we sing ancient mantras set to music.&nbsp;Typically it is done with a leader who ""calls"" the mantra, and the group who ""echoes"" the mantra, so we are singing back and forth to one another. <br></p>
<p>We set the mantras to music (as opposed to just speaking the words) because music bypasses the conscious, rational processes of the brain and helps access our emotions directly. Kirtan helps you tap into feelings of love, devotion, peace, and unity that are already present within your heart. <br></p>
<p><span>Kirtan is equal parts science and art. Humans figured out long ago that singing this way nourishes the mind, body and soul. By chanting together, we entrain our individual vibrations and raise each other up in a positive, loving way. Kirtan feels awesome! </span><span>You don't have to have any musical talent or experience with yoga to enjoy kirtan - it is for everyone.</span> <br></p>
<p> <br>Part of the beauty of kirtan is that it operates on many levels simultaneously. <br>Kirtan can: <br>♢ increase lung capacity to create deeper breathing <br></p>
<p>♦ restore balance between the right and left hemispheres of the brain, and between the physical and subtle bodies</p>
<p>♢ cultivate a meditative practice of being in the moment with the music -- turn off the anxious monkeymind ;)</p>
<p>♦ activate the parasympathetic nervous system, creating the relaxed state necessary for the body to heal itself</p>
<p>♢ provide an authentic way to spend time with people from many cultures and walks of life</p>
<p><span>♦ empower your energy system with the healing frequencies contained in ancient mantras</span></p>
<p>♢ help you connect with the divine aspects of yourself <br></p>
<p>The kirtan experience can be different from day to day and from one song to the next. Sometimes the energy is euphoric and powerful, inspiring dancing and drumming. Other times it is calm, introspective, nurturing and subtle. Afterwards, it always seems to feel like you got what you needed! <br> <br>Kirtan is an ancient practice yet it is constantly evolving. DJs and MCs are adding to the musical conversation, like DJ Drez --&nbsp;<a href=""https://bit.ly/2qeDbfe"">https://bit.ly/2qeDbfe</a> <br> <br>Other modern kirtan artists to check out: Krishna Das --&nbsp;<a href=""https://bit.ly/2EuP4CO"">https://bit.ly/2EuP4CO</a>&nbsp;, Jai Uttal, Wah, Deva Premal &amp; Miten, MC Yogi, DJ Drez, Ben Leinbach. <br> <br>♦ ♦ ♦ Our kirtan is 100% donation based, and your donations support bringing music classes to children in Bangkok through the Khlong Toey Music Program. ♦ ♦ ♦</p>",1477634322,Bangkok,Bangkok,TH,Thailand,"Bangkok, Thailand",,open,public,13.73,100.5,407,9498397,Cheryl Chaffee,I like the idea of people from different yoga studios coming together as a larger community.,Asia/Bangkok,14,Health & Wellbeing

<p>Hiii, I’m Claudia and I'm a Transformational Coach. <br>In my coaching I help people grow and become their real self – a self that is comfortable with being vulnerable and that is authentic.</p>
<p>Vulnerability is mostly defined as a weakness, but for me is where you open the doors for acceptance and compassion. Dr. Brené Brown says that “vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy and creativity” and that’s what I want to help you to achieve in this group journey together.</p>
<p>These are a few symptoms of lack of vulnerability and authenticity, we will discuss others during our meetings, just in case you are wondering how it looks like:</p>
<p>• Difficulties to say NO to others <br>• Don’t feel comfortable asking for help <br>• Negativity is priority in your mind <br>• Seek perfection constantly <br>• Need to be right <br>• Afraid of what people will think about you <br>• No able to say sorry when needed <br>• Always pressured about performance <br>• Be very critical to your own self <br>• Always needing approval from others <br>• Feel lonely or misunderstood <br>• Don’t have a voice in this world <br>• Feels like other people’s time/projects/ideas is more important than yours</p>
<p>And maybe, maybe, we never know….. some can be applied to you, if the answer is YES, I believe this group will be a good way for spending your Tuesday’s nights. <br>Looking forward to meet you there!</p>
<p>Some rules for these group meetings: <br>- Be on time. <br>- Be open to speak up <br>- Be open to listen <br>- Respect others <br>- This sessions will be treated as confidential (just come if you are ok with this part), it’s a safe space to talk and share your thoughts <br>- Be all IN and commit to the process</p>

<p><strong><span> <br> Thailand Naturism Meetup arranges meetings, events and <br> a forum for naturists or nudists in or visiting Thailand <br> and those that want to promote naturism worldwide.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Profile Photo Guidelines…Please follow them</strong> <br> Otherwise <strong>you may be removed as a member</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Your profile photo (1st picture)&nbsp;<strong>must contain you</strong>. <strong>Not a photo you have copied off the internet.</strong> <br> Afterwards you may upload any photos you like <br> 2. <strong>No erection penis shots</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>crotch shots</strong> or pornographic photos <br> 3.&nbsp;<strong>No Spread Eagle</strong> shots or where the <strong>genitals are the main focus point. <br> </strong> 4. Images containing nudity&nbsp;<strong>cannot</strong> contain anyone under the age of 18. <br> 5. We delete your membership if you picture contain only genitals, <br> 6. If you choose&nbsp;<strong>not to show your face</strong> then&nbsp;<strong>you may <span>NOT</span> show your genitals</strong>. <br> 7. All Photos are approved at the discretion of the administrator.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Common hesitations and questions</strong></em> <em><strong>to being nude with others.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><span>Everyone will think I am there for or want sex?</span> <br> </strong> <span>Naturism/Nudism is&nbsp;<strong>NOT</strong> <strong>about sex</strong>, if fact we seriously express great disapproval of anyone that expects that there be sex involved. Any member that promotes or solicits others for sex will be <strong>banned</strong>. What you do in private is up to you, but in our social setting it is unthinkable, and not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Everyone will be staring at me!</strong></span> <br> If you walk down main street or through a mall nude, people certainly would. At a nudist meeting everyone is nude and it we would consider it to be rude to do that.</p>
<p><span><strong>I'm (pick one) too fat, too skinny, my breasts are too small, my penis is small, by body is ugly, etc.</strong></span> <br> Our members are not beauty queens or Greek gods, just ordinary people like you. Naturists never make fun or ridicule another persons body. We accept that people’s bodies are different and as son as you do also you will feel better about yours.</p>
<p><strong><span>Will people think less of me if I am a Naturist/Nudist?</span> <br> </strong> Why should they? We are not going to tell anyone that you are. If anyone does then they are not your real friends as a real friend would be understanding of your feelings. One person that will think of you differently will be you. You will feel better about your body and your self image.</p>
<p><span><strong>What if someone I know is there?</strong></span> <br> If they are at same the resort or beach, they are nude also. Now you have something else in common. And something new to share and make your friendship stronger.</p>
<p><span><strong>What if someone finds out I'm a nudist?</strong></span> <br> We go to great lengths to protect the privacy of our members and guests. Nudism is really not anything to be ashamed of; it is practiced worldwide in many cultures. Really there are a lot of people that are nudists and don’t even know it.</p>
<p><span><strong>What type of person is a Naturist or Nudist?</strong></span> <br> They are people just like you, like anyone you might meet on the street. They enjoy not wearing clothes except for perhaps cold weather. They are friendly and like to meet people of a similar mind. Some people actually practice naturism at home and don’t even know there are resorts, beaches and organizations dedicated to providing facilities for them.</p>
<p><span><strong>Is Naturism/Nudism a new trend?</strong></span> <br> Not really. In fact most early cultures of the world, people bathed in rivers and lakes without clothes and with others, in some cultures including Thai, women went topless. Being nude is probably the most common condition of people. Take for example the natives of Africa or the Amazon, when scientists go and study them, they find them without clothes. Why? Because the natives don’t know about clothes and don’t know why they would need them. They don’t compare being nude with sex. Perhaps we have lost something about being humans.</p>
<p><span><strong>Why do some people (mostly women) still keep their clothes on?</strong></span> <br> They have a difficult time getting adjusted or believing the above facts. It is also hard to change culture conditioning. In addition to the conditioning we get from advertising.</p>
<p><strong><span>Please&nbsp;remember&nbsp;this is not a dating site. <br> </span></strong> When you enter it is like going into a room where you don't know anyone. The first thing you would do is to introduce yourself. The ONE thing you would not do when first entering is go around and say hello to all the women in the group, and try to hit on them.</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Email&nbsp;Address&nbsp;- If you do not leave an&nbsp;email&nbsp;address, that is OK, but the Meetup site will delete you after 3-6 months of inactivity.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>WE ARE NOT a dating site or a place for swingers. <br> DO NOT introduce yourself to more than 2 members at a time. <br> This is not a chat room.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>DO NOT say hello to more than 3 members at one time! <br> </strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>DO NOT POST sexual photos, or anything</strong></span> <span><strong>that is considered of a sexual nature.</strong></span></span></p>

We believe that respect for individual rights is the essential precondition for a free and prosperous world, that force and fraud must be banished from human relationships, and that only through freedom can peace and prosperity be realized.

Consequently, we defend each person's right to engage in any activity that is peaceful and honest, and welcome the diversity that freedom brings. The world we seek to build is one where individuals are free to follow their own dreams in their own ways, without interference from government or any authoritarian power.

We have set forth our basic principles and enumerated various policy stands derived from those principles.

It's a nice way to spend an afternoon and meet some diverse new people, whether residents or travellers, maybe even have a laugh or some interesting conversation (you never know lol). If we want we can bring food/drinks although the idea isn't to get sloshed (I know what a lot of expats and travellers are like!). People who want to can also bring some of their own music to play, and we can take turns selecting awesome songs on our phones. Ok so for those who don't understand I'm talking about underground or at least quality electronica, stuff that has integrity and content and is true to the old school, not edm, pop or commercial bullshit. If you want to hear that go to many of the atrocious nightclubs BKK has on offer :) I'm not going to regulate the music people play, but I do want to create an atmosphere of music that is underground/quality. (Also if you have a great track you want to play, it doesn't have to fall into the exact genres just mentioned, which are just general guidelines). Here's an example of some music I might play to give you an idea: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgYVtCkm4Mc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgYVtCkm4Mc</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOjYYTuMtQg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOjYYTuMtQg</a> <br> </p>
<p>Also was thinking when we get going a bit we could also use the group to post some quality dance parties/nightlife and attend some together, so it could be a good way of connecting people in the underground dance community, or who just who just like to go party. Maybe even go for some walks around the city to get to discover it more and find new spots to sit and play music. <br></p>
<p>If anyone has any other ideas or suggestions please contact me- this group is a democracy and input would be great :) <br></p>
<p>One hard and fast rule though is NO SHAZAMING. If you want to know what a tune is, ask whoever is playing it. People are sharing their tunes, which is generous, so be polite back :)<br></p>",1562736520,Bangkok,Bangkok,TH,Thailand,"Bangkok, Thailand",,open,public,13.73,100.5,42,26958742,Alessandro Dales,,Asia/Bangkok,21,Music

<p>Parent Talk</p>
<p>Three of the great thinkers of childhood development are Eric Erickson, Jean Piaget, and Benjamin Spock. Erickson, as I recall, believed that parents needed to be like nets, there to catch children as they fall when making independent movements away from the family. Piaget argued that children were animistic thinkers, and Spock, among other things, opposed all forms of spankings. This group allows parents to come in and talk about better forms of parenting. <br></p>

<p><b>About you: </b><br>You need to finish that thesis, that sprint, that book, that proposal, or whatever's else is on your scary to-do list. You have work to do, and no time to mess around. <br>But you also wanna get your work done sooner to enjoy some sunshine, your hobby, that side hustle, get fit, go to the pub, or to be a better parent. <br>You understand that if you can really get on top of your productivity, you'll feel better about yourself, and you'll have time for the things and people you love.</p>
<p><b>What Is Deep Diving?: </b><br>A unique approach to co-working productivity based around a deep sea diving analogy:&nbsp;<span>The Deep Divers form a Dive Team. They buddy up and help each other prioritise work, set and track targets, be accountable to them, and fiercely defend each other from sharks (distractions).</span></p>
<p><b>What happens on a Dive Day? </b><br>There are 3 x 2hr Dive Sessions, where we descend into The Deep, an area of zero distractions... nothing to do but work. Each Dive Session has 4 Dives of 25 mins where we plunge deeply into our work. Between each Dive we will take 5 minutes to decompress in the Dive Bell, an area of minimal distractions where buddies quickly check in. Between each 2hr Dive Session, the Dive Team returns to the surface to have a coffee, a meal, and to talk tactics on improving productivity. </p>

It's our prayer and hope as many who read or attend our meeting will Spiritually, Financially, Morally, Support what God is doing in this new Millenniun, through this Ministry.</p>
